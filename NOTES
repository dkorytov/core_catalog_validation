Infall mass must exist!

on datastar, try running this on:
/media/luna1/prlarsen/core_stuff/09_03_2019.AQ.102.coreproperties

/media/luna1/dkorytov/projects/core_tracking/core_subhalo_comparison

./subhalo_comparison.py

2 steps: fof linking of cores
(set linking length to 0 to bypass this)

then subhalo_comparison

- mass cut when you load the dictionary and the selec_dict

plots are saved in "figs"

=======
[ ] FOF_halo_tag + central flag should be unique within file 

[ ] All FoF 'real' halos above the mass have a core

[ ] All centrals infall step is the current step
[ ] All centrals should have the same infall_mass as the host halo

[X] Infall_tree_node_index should be unique within file

[ ] FOF properties with mass above threshold value should have a core (with the same halo tag)
[X] Merger tree objects at step 499 should have cores (central should have the same tree node index, halo tag, and infall of 499). 
[X] Infall mass must exist!



FAQ:

- why do we have negative fof_halo_tags?/why are fof_halo_tags missing from the core catalog?

A: fragment halos in the merger trees. Talk to Steve Rangel about this for more details
