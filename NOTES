[X] Check positions range are reasonable

[X] Check that all halos have exactly one central
   check_central()
   -fragment halos may have no core/central

Infall mass must exist!

2 steps: fof linking of cores
(set linking length to 0 to bypass this)

then subhalo_comparison

- mass cut when you load the dictionary and the selec_dict

plots are saved in "figs"

=======
[ ] FOF_halo_tag + central flag should be unique within file 
[ ] All FoF 'real' halos above the mass have a core
[ ] All centrals infall step is the current step
[ ] All centrals should have the same infall_mass as the host halo
[ ] Infall_tree_node_index should be unique within file
[ ] FOF properties with mass above threshold value should have a core (with the same halo tag)
[ ] Merger tree objects at step 499 should have cores (central should have the same tree node index, halo tag, and infall of 499). 
[ ] Infall mass must exist!
