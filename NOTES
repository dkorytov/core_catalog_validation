Check for uniqueness of core tags

FOF_halo_tag + central flag should be unique within file 

Infall_tree_node_index should be unique within file

FOF properties with mass above threshold value should have a core (with the same halo tag)

Merger tree objects at step 499 should have cores (central should have the same tree node index, halo tag, and infall of 499). 

Infall mass must exist!

2 steps: fof linking of cores
(set linking length to 0 to bypass this)

then subhalo_comparison

- mass cut when you load the dictionary and the selec_dict

plots are saved in "figs"

plot_unmatched_Cores_subhalos (300 of them)
