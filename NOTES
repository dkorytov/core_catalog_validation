[ ] Check for uniqueness of core tags

[ ] FOF_halo_tag + central flag should be unique within file 
[ ] All FoF 'real' halos above the mass 
[ ] All centrals infall step is the current step
[ ] All centrals should have the same infall_mass as the host halo

[ ] Infall_tree_node_index should be unique within file

[ ] FOF properties with mass above threshold value should have a core (with the same halo tag)

[ ] Merger tree objects at step 499 should have cores (central should have the same tree node index, halo tag, and infall of 499). 

[ ] Infall mass must exist!
